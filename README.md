# migration1
> this repo was originally called "test-repo".  Renamed it to be more descriptive.

### Notes on our first migration

- Ran into significant rate limits
- Script finally finished after working all night.
- Somewhat difficult to view (filter) just the tracking issues (bounties).
  - can enter `in:body "imported from"` like [this](https://github.com/dashtesting/migration1/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+in%3Abody+%22imported+from%22).
- Labels might help filtering
- See **dashtesting** [profile README](https://github.com/dashtesting) for notes about next steps.

### Issue Limits
Not sure if we ran into this on this migration repo or another, but AJ got this message at some point:
> "message": "Projects cannot have more than 1200 items. To add more, please archive or delete existing items."

Good to know for design purpose
- maybe we'll need more than one big project that covers all of Incubator
