# migration1
> this repo was originally called "test-repo".  Renamed it to be more descriptive.

### Notes on our first migration

- Ran into significant rate limits
- Script finally finished after working all night.
- Somewhat difficult to view (filter) just the tracking issues (bounties).
  - can enter `in:body "imported from"` like [this](https://github.com/dashtesting/migration1/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+in%3Abody+%22imported+from%22).
- Labels might help filtering
- See **dashtesting** [profile README](https://github.com/dashtesting) for notes about next steps.
